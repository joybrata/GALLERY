In 1462, he became an apprentice to Fra Filippo Lippi, an Italian painter, where he learned painting techniques in a more intimate and detailed manner. By 1470, Sandro had his own art workshop. His works are mostly characterized by clear contours of figures, and few strong contrasts of light and shadow. The Mystical Nativity is his only work in which he signed."

Painted in 1486, The Birth of Venus has been the subject of endless intellectual speculation and interpretations of meaning. The painting depicts a voluptuous nude female standing gracefully upon a large seashell which appears to emerge onto shore from the ocean. To her left is a male angel floating in the air and clutching a woman in a tight embrace. To the right of the Venus is another woman in flowing garments, appearing to hail the arrival of the “goddess.”"
