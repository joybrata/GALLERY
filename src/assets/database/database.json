The scene we are shown is when Christ tells his followers that he is to be betrayed and that he will be leaving them very soon. In the groups of three, we see the reactions from the apostles to the news. From the far left, we have the first group who all look surprised. No doubt, all would be thinking that they would never betray the Messiah. The next group, it is likely that Judas is the one holding what appears to be a bag (perhaps of silver?). Behind him is likely Peter, Jesus’ number one disciple who appears angry at the news. And the other person is likely one of the younger apostles, as he appears to swoon. Many have suggested that this is Mary Magdalene, perhaps inspired by the famous Da Vinci Code book. To the right of Christ, the next group of apostles appears to perhaps be questioning Christ as to the suggestion of betrayal, while the group on the far right is likely discussing loudly regarding the news."

				"about_pic": "The Mona Lisa is quite possibly the most well-known piece of painted artwork in the entire world. It was painted by the Leonardo Da Vinci, the famous Italian artist, between 1504 and 1519, and is a half body commission for a woman named Lisa Gherardini. Her husband, Francesco Del Giocondo requested the work by Da Vinci just after the turn of the century. It is perhaps the most studied piece of artwork ever known. The subject’s facial expression has brought about a source of debate for centuries, as her face remains largely enigmatic in the portrait. Originally commissioned in Italy, it is now at home in the French Republic, and hangs on display in the Louvre in Paris."

It has very intricate details throughout the piece and was created somewhere between 1487 and 1488. It currently hangs in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas where it is part of a permanent collection. It passed hands from American art dealers to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York before it arrived to this destination after being sold. It was sold for over $6 million dollars, but the exact amount is not known."
